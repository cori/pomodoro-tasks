pomodoro-tasks
==============

Simple activity tracking of estimated/actual pomodoros and interruptions, for use with an external pomodoro timer. 

It seems as though every [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com) timer with an integrated activity list integrates the timer and the list too tightly - generally the only way to register interruptions or actual pomodoros against an activity is by using the integrated timer.

This little app is for Pomodoro Technique devotees who have a timer they like but want to have an activity list that they can use for tracking and reporting.
